% is_proper: int â†’ boolean that given a number calculates if it is a perfect number or not, where a perfect number is a positive 
% integer equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors (excluding itself), e.g., 6 is a perfect number since 1, 2 and 3 
% are the proper divisors of 6 and 6 is equal to 1+2+3;
